# a summary about you
summary: 'I am a passionate software engineer with five years of experience. I primarily work on enterprise system software, where I develop applications and integrate OSS solutions into event-driven architectures, both on-premises and in the cloud. I specialize in the Kubernetes platform, which I also use in my homelab for my workloads. I am a generalist who loves system design and tackling large-scale architectures. For this reason, I am trying to learn various aspects of system design to become a system architect. In my spare time, I enjoy building things in my homelab and practicing Muay Thai as an amateur.'
